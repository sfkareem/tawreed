"""Tawreed — entry point.

Two ways to launch:

    python main.py            (development)
    python -m tawreed         (after `pip install -e .`)
    dist\\Tawreed\\Tawreed.exe  (PyInstaller onedir build)

The launcher does four things in order:
    1. Initialise the database (fast, <100ms).
    2. Build the SingleApplication. If another instance is running,
       signal it to come to the foreground and exit.
    3. Show the splash screen with "Loading...".
    4. Build the main window, show it, and finish the splash.

qasync is set up around the Qt event loop so the AI streaming
QThread worker can integrate cleanly.
